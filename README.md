# EventHorizon: Soroban-to-Web2 Automation Platform

EventHorizon is a decentralized "If-This-Then-That" (IFTTT) platform that listens for specific events emitted by Stellar Soroban smart contracts and triggers real-world Web2 actions like webhooks, Discord notifications, or emails.

## 🚀 How it Works

1.  **If This**: A Soroban smart contract emits an event (e.g., `SwapExecuted`, `LiquidityAdded`).
2.  **Then That**: EventHorizon's worker detects the event and triggers a configured action (e.g., POST to a webhook).

## 📂 Project Structure

-   `/backend`: Node.js/Express server and Soroban event poller worker.
-   `/frontend`: Vite/React dashboard for managing triggers.
-   `/contracts`: Boilerplate Soroban Rust contract for testing.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB
- Rust & Soroban CLI (for contracts)

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both root and subdirectories.
2. Update `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` (e.g., `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`).
3. Update `MONGO_URI`.

### Running Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start backend
npm run dev:backend

# Start frontend
npm run dev:frontend
```

## 🧪 Testing with the Boilerplate Contract
1. Deploy the contract in `/contracts`.
2. Copy the Contract ID.
3. Add a new trigger in the dashboard using the Contract ID and event name `test_event`.
4. Invoke the `trigger_event` function on the contract.
5. Watch the backend logs/webhook for the triggered action!
